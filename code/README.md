# Project Survey

create a Typeform-like survey to collect data from users by using the `useState` hook in React and connect HTML form inputs to state.


## The problem

1. I could not display buttons frpn Start to Next so I use if statements in Survey.js and also added it to the rest of the components.
2. Need to find out how I can add images as a map function to the components. Right now I have it as an image tag for every images in the component.
